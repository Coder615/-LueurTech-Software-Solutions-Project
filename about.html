     <p>Gummisig is a freelance web designer who likes to talk about himself in the third person.
        He also makes great use of oversized text to bring attention to his work in a humorous manner.
        Perhaps what’s striking about this page is that it introduces Gummisig’s portfolio, but also reflects his free spirit and commitment.  
        And while he mentions the household names he worked for in the past, he remains approachable and open to new collaborations.
        Perhaps the most striking feature behind this page is that it acts as a preface to the designer’s portfolio, mirroring his free spirit and a remarkable passion for design
        While he proudly states the companies he has worked for (IKEA is just one of the bigger names to pop up), he does so in a manner that is not boastful.
